Pokemon Battle Game is a independent API Project.

## Project Description

This is an independently developed web application aimed at applying skills learned through the BrainStation Software Engineering program.
The project utilizes the PokeAPI to create a Pokemon battle game using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript.
Players can select their Pokemon, generate a random opponent, and simulate battles.

## Features

1. Pokemon Selection: Users can choose their Pokemon from a dropdown menu populated with data fetched from the PokeAPI.
2. Random Enemy Generation: The application randomly selects an opponent Pokemon for each battle.
3. Battle Simulation: Simulates battles between the selected Pokemon and the enemy Pokemon, displaying results with health bars and animations.

4. Restart Battle: Allows users to reset and play again with new Pokemon selections.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML: Structure of the web page.

2. Sass: Styling to enhance visual appeal and maintainability.
3. JavaScript: Implementation of game logic, data retrieval, and user interactions.
